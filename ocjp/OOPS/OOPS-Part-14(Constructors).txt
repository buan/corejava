Constructors
============
Once we create an object, we need initilization for objects to perform effectively

Whenever we are creating an object,some piece of code will be executed to perform initialization of object.This piece of code is nothing but constructor.Hence main purpose of constructor is initialization of object

class Test {

	String name;
	int roll;

	public Test(String name, int roll) {
		this.name = name;
		this.roll = roll;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Test t1 = new Test("w1", 4);
		Test t2 = new Test("w2", 4);

	}
}

t1.name=w1,t1.roll=4
advantage:LOC reduced,

Main purpose of constructor is to perform initialization of object but not to create object

Difference between constructor and instance block
-------------------------------------------------
Main purpose of constructor=initialization but other than initialization if we want to perform any activity for object creation,then we should go for instance block(like updating 1 entry in DB)

Both constructor and instance block their own different purposes and replacing one concept with another concept may not work always

Both constructor and instance block will be executed for object creation but instance block call is followed by constructor

Rules for declaring constructor
-------------------------------
1)Return type concept not applicable for constructor.By mistake if we are trying to declare return type for the constructor then we wont get any compile time error because compiler treats it as a method

class Test{
void Test(){

}//method not constructor
}

2)The only applicable modifiers for constructtors are public,private,protected ,default.If we are trying to use any other modifiers, we will get CE


class Test{
staticTest(){

}//not allowed
}

3)Compiler is responsible to generate default constructor(but not jvm).If we are not writing any constructor, then only default constructor will be generated by compiler ie if we are writing atleast 1 constructor,then compiler wont generate default constructor hence every class in java can contain constructor.It may be default constructor generated by compiler or customized constructor explicitly provided by programmer but not both simultaneously
