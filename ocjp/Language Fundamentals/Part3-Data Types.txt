Data types
===========
In Java every variable should have some datatype.Every assignment should be checked by compiler for type compatibility.Because of this,Java language is strongly typed language

Java is not considered as pure oopl because oops features are not satisfied by java like operator overloading,multiple inheritance etc.Moreover we are depending on primitive data type which are not objects

Primitive Data Types
====================
1)Numeric data types 2) Non numeric data types

Numeric->Integral DT, Float point DT

Integral->byte,short,int,long
Float point->float,double

Non numeric-> char,boolean

Except boolean and char all datatypes are called signed datatypes. Can be converted to -v1 and +ve

byte
====
size-1 byte(8 bits)
lsb=sign bit so remaining bits are 7. (+ve=1,-ve=0)
max_value=2 power 7=128-1=+127
min_value=-128

which are valid
===============
byte b=10(v)
byte b=127(v)
byte b=128(iv)-ic
byte b=10.5(iv)-ic
byte b=true(iv)-ic
byte b="A"(iv)-ic

If you want to handle data in terms of streams either from file or from network,byte datatype can be used.

short
======
size-2 bytes(16 bits)
lsb=sign bit so remaining bits are 15. (+ve=1,-ve=0)
max_value=2 power 15=32768-1=+32767
min_value=-32767


This is most rarely used in Java.This is suitable for 16bit processor.

short s=32767(v)
short s=32767(iv)->incompatible types.possible loss of precision(found int required short)
short s=10.5 iv
short s=true iv

int
===
Most common used datatype in java

size-4 bytes(32 bits)
lsb=sign bit so remaining bits are 31. (+ve=1,-ve=0)
max_value=2 power 31-1
min_value=-2 power 31

Long
=====
Sometimes int is not sufficient to hold values. In that case,we use long.
For eg-speed of light,distance travelled by a planet,length of a file

The num of characters present in a big file may exceed int. Hence we need long data type

size-8 bytes(64 bits)
lsb=sign bit so remaining bits are 63. (+ve=1,-ve=0)
max_value=2 power 64-1
min_value=-2 power 63

All the above datatypes represent integral values. If we want to represent, floating point values, we will use float and double


Float vs double
===============
Float			Double
Represent 5-6 		Represent 10-14		
decimal places		after decimal
		
Single Precision	Double Precision

size:4 bytes		size:8 bytes

range:-1.7e38->1.7e38	range:-3.4e38->3.4e38


Boolean
=======
size-NA[VM dependant]
range-NA[allowed values are true and false]
default value=false
boolean b=true[v]
boolean b=0[iv,found int required boolean]
boolean b=True[iv,ce, cannot find symbol:variable True,location:test]

True is treated as variable

boolean b="True"[iv,ce ic found java.lang,string req:boolean]

Eg-
====
public class Test {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x=0;
		if(x)
			System.out.println("Hi");
		else
			System.out.println("Hello");
	}

}
CE,ic,found int required boolean


public class Test {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		while(1) {
			System.out.println(1);
		}

}

same error
 works in C and other languages but java is strongly typed language


char
=====
Old languages are ASCII code based and the number of different allowed ASCII characters <=256.To represent these 256 characters,8 bits are enough,hence the size of char in old languages is 1 byte. But Java is UNICODE based and the number of different unicode characters>256 and <=65536. To represent these many characters 8 bits may not be enough. Compulsory we should go for 16 bits,hence the size of char in java is 2 bytes

size:2 bytes
range:0-65536
default value=0[space]
