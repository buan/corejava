Array Element assignments
Array variable assignment

Array->indexed collection of,fixed number of homogeneous data elements.Main advantage of arrays is we can represent huge number of values by using single variable so that 
readability of the code will be improved. But the main disadvantage of arrays is fixed in size ie once we create an array there is no chance of increasing or decreasing based on our requirement.Hence to use arrays concept,we should always know size in advance,which may not be possible always

Array Declaration
=================
int x[];
int []x;
int[] x;->recommended.because name is clearly seperated from type.

int[6] x;(iv)->at the time of declaration,we cant specify size,otherwise error
int[] x;(v)

Double Dimension arrays
=======================
int[][] x;
int   [][] x;
int x[][];

int[]  []x;
int [] x[];
int  []x[];

All are valid

Which of the following are valid
================================
int[] a,b;[a=1,b=1]
int[] a[],b;[a=2,b=1]
int[]  a[],b[];[a=2,b=2]
int[] []a,b;[a=2,b=2](in this case, if dimension is given before variable,compiler will consider int[] [] as common,in that case a,b both will have 2(int [][] a,int [][] b)
int[] []a,b[];[a=2,b=3](CE because dimension before variable name is only possible for 1st variable. for other variables this rule is not applicable,hence error)
