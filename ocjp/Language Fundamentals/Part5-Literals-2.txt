char ch='a'(v)
char ch=a(iv) a does not fall in any datatype. so java considers it a variable. but there is no variable
char c="A"(iv) it found string req char
char c='ab' unclosed char literal.unclosed char literal.not a java statement

We can specify char literal as intergral literal which represents unicode value of the character and that integral literal can be specified either in decimal or octal or hexadecimal forms but allowed range is 0-65535

char c=97 sop(c)->a

char ch=OXFace(v) 
char ch=0777(V)
char ch=OXFace(v)
char ch=65535(v)
char ch=65536(iv)PLP found int req char

We can represent char literal in unicode representation which is nothing but '\uXXXX'->xxxx is hexadecimal num

eg
char c='\u00061'
SOP(c)=>a

Every escape character is a valid char literal


char c='\n'
char c='\t'
char c='\m'->illegal

8 escape char
\n->newline
\t->horizontal tab
\r->carriage return
\b->back space
\'->single quote
\"->double quote
\\->single backslash

SOP(

which are valid

char c=65536->iv
char c=oXbeer->iv->r is not hexad
char c=\uface->iv->quotes missing
char c='\ubeef'->v
char c='\m'->iv->no escape char
char c='\iface'->iv

String literal
==============
Any sequence of characters in double quotes

String s="sss";

1.7 enhnacements with respect to literals.Allowed digits are 0 and 1.Literal value should be prefixed with 0B/0b

a)Binary Literals-int x=0B1111;SOP(x)->15


Usage of underscore symbols in numeric literals
===============================================
From 1.7 version onwards, we can use _ symbol between digits of numeric literal.

eg-
double d=123134.456
	||
	\/
double d=1_23_134.4_5_6

Main advantage of this approach is readability of code will be improved.
At the time of compilation,these _ symbols will be removed automatically,hence after compilation the above lines will become
double d=123134.456

We can use more than 1 _ symbols between the digits
double d=1___23__13_4.45__6;

We can use_ symbol only between the digits.If we are using anywhere else, we will get CT error

eg-
double d=_1_23.45_0(iv)
double d=1_23_.45_0(iv)
double d=1_23.45_0_(iv)

byte->short->int->long->float->double
1	2     
char->int

long->float?how?
8 byte long value we can assign to 4 byte float variable because both are following different memory representation internally
but char cannot be assigned to short
float f=10L;
SOP(f);10.0
