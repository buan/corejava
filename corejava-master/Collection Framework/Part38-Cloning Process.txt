Every collection class implementing cloneable and serializable interface
Cloning
=======
Process of creating exactly duplicate objects

by default cloneing is not supported by your class.Your class must implements cloneable interface.Cloneable is a marked interface(no methods but class getting some capabilities)


Clone copies the object from heap
eg-
public class test implements Cloneable {

	int a = 3;
	int b = 5;

	public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
		test t = new test();
		System.out.println(t.a);
		System.out.println(t.b);
		
		test t2=(test)t.clone();
		System.out.println(t2.a);
		System.out.println(t2.b);

	}

}
